# Court Room

**Courtroom** is an adversarial evidence-locked decision engine. A user poses any dilemma ("Should CMU require AI ethics courses?"), and a system of AI agents debates it like a courtroom trial — except every claim must be backed by real evidence fetched via MCP tool calls. Users can intervene mid-debate — even mid-sentence — to shift the argument. The output is not just a verdict, but an explanation that can be verified, understood, and believed.

More simply: Courtroom is adversarial problem solving: AI agents competing on evidence, not rhetoric to answer your questions.
